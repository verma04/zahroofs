			<h1>REDUCING TOTAL COST OF OPERATION</h1>

			<h2>Our StraightFlo Valve Guarantee</h2>

			<p>
			Zahroof Valves Inc. guarantees, within limitations, that the compressor MTBS (Mean Time Between Service for valve related issues) will be increased by at least 100% using the StraightFlo valve compared to the compressor MTBS with the valves it replaces, in the same compressor running under the same conditions. For the guarantee, the service interval record of the prior valves are required with the operating condition history.
</p> <p>
Zahroof Valves Inc. guarantees, within limitations, that the performance of your compressor will improve upon using the StraightFlo Valves relative to your existing valves, in the same compressor running under the same operating conditions. For the guarantee, compressor flow and power measurements are required for both the StraightFlo valve and the prior valves under the same operating conditions, with the cylinder in the same condition in both instances.
</p> <p>
Zahroof Valves Inc. provides a ten year limited warranty on the stainless steel seat and carrier.

For low speed applications (below 600 rpm), with good quality gas, Zahroof Valves Inc. provides a 5 year limited warranty on the valve internals (the modules).
