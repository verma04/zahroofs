  <h1>Reduce Environmental Impact</h1>
<ul>

 <li>    Higher efficiency valves result in lower fuel consumption for the same work. 10% lower fuel consumption in a typical 1000 rpm high speed pipeline compression application with our standard StraightFlo valves.
 </li><li> Reduce fuel consumption and hence emissions with a simple change of valves. Minimize your Carbon footprint.
 </li><li>Increased compressor service intervals of 5X to more than 10X with StraightFlo valves mean reduced methane emissions due to blow-down of pipes, venting, purging and flaring.
 </li><li>Reduce waste. Never machine or replace the valve seat or guard. Service interval doubled.
 </li><li>Reduce vibration and noise. No impact of high mass elements on metal valve seats or guards. Noise levels drop by 7db or more. Vibration levels drop by a factor of 10.
