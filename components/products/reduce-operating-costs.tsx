	<h2>		Minimize Fuel Costs </h2>

<ul>
 <li>  With the highly efficient StraightFlo valve, fuel costs can be reduced considerably.
  </li> <li> In the case of a typical pipeline transmission compressor running at 1000 rpm,
the fuel consumption is reduced by 10%.
</li> <li> With a reduction in fuel, there is a corresponding reduction in emissions.
</li> <li> Operations can decide to increase the throughput through the compressor and keep the power/fuel the same.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>




<h2>Minimize Service Costs 		</h2>

 <li> The StraightFlo valve design eliminates wear on the seat and carrier. Never machine or replace your valve seat or carrier, the most expensive part of the valve. There is a 10 year warranty on the valve seat and carrier.
 </li> <li> Simply replace the old modules with new ones, in the field, on-site, to return your valves to factory new condition. Eliminate machining, off-site repair, special tools and skilled labor.
 </li> <li> 2 - 5X improvement in service interval with StraightFlo valves means less downtime for servicing valves. It also reduces emissions due to blow down of pipes, venting, purging and flaring.
 </li> <li> Minimize Downtime and Loss of Revenue
 </li> <li> With the enhanced reliability of the StraightFlo valve and the improvement of the compressor MTBS by 5 to more than 10X, minimize the compressor downtime and the resulting loss in production/revenue.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	

 <h2> Minimize Inventory Costs </h2>
  <li> Stock boxes of modules instead of racks and racks of expensive assembled valves for all makes and models of compressors, cylinders and operating conditions. About 5 - 6 module part numbers are sufficient for a company to service all its compressor valves, in all regions, at all operating conditions.
  </li> <li> Reduce inventory by 80%. Minimize inventory foot-print and weight.
  </li> <li> Minimize cost of inventory management and risk of obsolescence of inventory .
 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	
 <h2> Minimize Capital Costs </h2>

 <li> Never replace the metal housing. Servicing a valve is done within minutes at the compressor site. This makes it unnecessary to buy spare valves with the modular StraightFlo valve.
 </li> <li> When field conditions change over time, replace the modules to get an optimum valve for the new conditions. Eliminate having to purchase a new set of valves.
</li> <li> By increasing throughput in existing compressors by 3 - 18%, eliminate the need for a new compressor to meet higher flow demands. Or, decommission one or more existing compressors.
</li>
</ul>
